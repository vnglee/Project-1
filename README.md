# Project-1

This is my first project from the Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp. 

The first few weeks consisted of learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - in which we would develop a simple game application. My project consists of only one instruction: avoid hitting the potholes. The layout and design was inspired by retro and pixelated graphics that reminded me of my childhood and the games I played growing up. 

Other features of this game includes:
  - varying sizes of potholes
  - increment of speed of the potholes after a certain a amount of time
  - score tracker
  - music and animation sprite
